                <p>I'm a student at York University in Toronto GTA, where I study business economics <a href="https://futurestudents.yorku.ca/program/business-economics/laps">Program</a>.

                <p>
                  At York University I've worked on developing my knowledge and understanding of the business world and the global market. I hope to use these skills to further develop my career in retail. I aspire to be a district manager for a global scale luxury company in the future. I started my retail journey with Armani <a href="https://www.armani.com/en-ca/experience/armani-exchange?gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIu5-d_byxhQMVSxitBh2l5QjXEAAYASAAEgK_NPD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">Experience</a>. at Toronto Premium Outlet <a href="https://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlet/toronto">outlet</a> My position within the company was a sales associate. I learned skills for visual merchandising and helping customers create the perfect outfit. Through this job I was referred to Ferragamo <a href="https://shop.ferragamo.com/shop/ca/en?ds_cid=71700000117305222&utm_campaign=LOWER_PURC_CA_CA-EN_ALW_ADW_BRAND-PURE_SRC&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIx_LU_72xhQMVJm1HAR2DUwACEAAYASAAEgLBR_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">shop</a>. At Ferragamo, I held the position as a  client advisor. I focused on visually merchandising the store and wardrobing elite clients, as well as walk in clients. I stayed with the company for approximately 4 years and won awards recognising my KPI. During my tenure I held the highest average for units per transaction, average dollar sale, cross-selling, and most moved clients to the next spend bracket. To continue my growth I recently received a promotion through YSL, Saint Laurent <a href="https://www.ysl.com/en-ca?gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-KOJvsCxhQMVXJWDBx1k2wCkEAAYASAAEgKD6fD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">en-ca</a>.  This promotion grants me the title of Senior Client Advisor, which is an entry level manageement position. I am able to develop my skills on training staff and encouraging growth within a team to hit commercial sale target goals.  This new position is based on Bloor St in Toronto, where I will be exposed to a larger volume of elite clients, and sales averaging $10k. I am excited to continue my. journey in retail and be exposed to new and exciting challenges.
